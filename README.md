Universal Jobmatch client

A Universal Jobmatch client designed to improve the user experience
of the website, help organise and track job applications, and automatically
leave progress notes on their account.

# What is Universal Jobmatch?
Universal Jobmatch is a UK Government jobsearch website. Its' usage is 
mandatory for people claiming benefits, and are looking for work.
To be entitled to benefits, a claimant has to spend 30 hours a week looking
for work, and is monitored in daily/weekly/bi-weekly meetings.
If a benefit recipient is deemed not to be looking for work because of not
enough evidence on their Universal Jobmatch account, they can be sanctioned
and have their financial lifeline postponed.


We want to help jobseekers provide that evidence, automatically: so that their
jobsearch activity is verbosely noted.
